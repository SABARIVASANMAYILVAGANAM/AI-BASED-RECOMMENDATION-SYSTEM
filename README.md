# DESCRIPTION
This Java program is a simple AI-based recommendation system that uses the Apache Mahout library to suggest items for users based on their preferences. It reads user ratings from a CSV file, compares them using Pearson correlation similarity, and recommends items that similar users have liked. By analyzing patterns in the data, the system helps predict what a user might be interested in, making it useful for applications like movie, product, or content recommendation platforms.
